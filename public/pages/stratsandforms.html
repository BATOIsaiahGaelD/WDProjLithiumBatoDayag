        <h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
        <h3>Vertical stack:</h3>
        The vertical (vert) stack is an offensive Ultimate Frisbee strategy that organizes cutters in a straight line near the center of the field to keep the throwing lane clear. 
        Since the marker forces one side, the lane becomes the easiest place to complete passes, so players take turns cutting to avoid clogging of players. 
        Teams pre-assign cutting order, usually starting from the back of the stack, with players making in-cuts, out-cuts, or deep cuts and clearing if they’re not open. 
        If no pass is available, a dump resets the stall and the stack reforms, repeating until yards are gained or a score is made.

    </br></br>
        <h3>Horizontal stack:</h3>
        The horizontal (ho) stack is an offensive Ultimate Frisbee strategy that , especially effective against a cup defense. 
        It uses three handlers who maintain possession through dumps and swings while four cutters are split into left and right sides, cutting only on their side of the field. 
        Cutters time their in-cuts and out-cuts, becoming open as the disc swings between handlers and the defense resets. 
        When a cutter receives the disc, they quickly dump it back to a handler, gaining small but consistent yards. 
        Teams often add variations to confuse defenders, such as middle cutters acting as poppers or switching roles mid-play.

        <h3>Man-to-man defense:</h3>
        Man-to-man defense is the most common Ultimate Frisbee defensive strategy, where each defender is assigned one specific opponent to guard for an entire point. 
        The goal is to stay between your player and the disc, prevent them from getting open, and stall them if they catch it. 
        Before the pull, the defensive team “calls lines” to decide who guards which opponent by numbering players from left to right. 
        Each defender calls out a number to claim their matchup and must remember that person, even if positions shift. New lines are usually called after each point to adjust for substitutions.
​
        <h3>Cup defense:</h3>
        The cup is a zone defense in Ultimate Frisbee where three defenders form a “cup” around the thrower to block throwing lanes. 
        Instead of guarding individual players, each of the seven defenders covers a specific area, working together to limit options and pressure the thrower. 
        The four closest defenders move as a unit, quickly reforming the cup after each pass to prevent easy swings. Wings and a deep defender protect cutters and stop long throws that escape the cup. 
        Teams must also watch for “poppers,” cutters who crash the cup late in the stall count to reset the offense. 
        When a turnover happens and the cup cannot quickly reset, switching to man defense is often the safest backup option. To learn more about the cup defense, go to this link!
