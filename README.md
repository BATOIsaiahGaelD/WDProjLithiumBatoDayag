<h3>JavaScript Implementation:</h3>
JavaScript plays an important role in web development by transforming a static HTML and CSS into a dynamic, lively, and interactive experience for users. This includes features such as drop down menus, checkboxes, etc. Some pages require to click in order to show info, so we will be using javascript. Animations will also be present in many of the pages, an example is the disc spinning. One entire page is about minigames such as clicking at the correct time, rolling a random disc color, and a quiz, so we will be using javascript to code those games.

<h1>UPDATED PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1>

<h3>What is HTML forms?</h3>
HTML forms gets the user's input and saves it in order for it to be used somewhere else. For our website, we want to have a sign-up and login page, as well as use HTML forms for one of our own minigames in the minigames page. All of the data accumulated from these pages will be for a profile page.

<h3> Implementation of HTML Forms (per page)</h3>

- First, we would like to have a sign-in and log-in page in order to have an account for our website. This account will record your data in minigames and will contain info about your user. All of this data will be displayed in the profile page, which will be a page showcasing all of your data (such as fastest recorded reaction time, name, preferences, etc). These pages will get your username, password, and jersey number.

- Second, we will have the profile page. This page will contain all the data from the sign-up and login page. There is an edit profile buton below the profile which will link you to another page.

- Third, we will have the edit profile page. This page will allow you to edit specific parts of your profile for more customization. It will use radio selectors and input boxes.

- Fourth, we have the quiz page from the minigames page. This page will make you answer 20 questions related to the website and Frisbee overall. We will use a lot of HTML forms, especially text boxes, radio selectors, and checkboxes. Some questions may be select all correct/wrong, fill-in the blank, and multiple choice. Their max score will be 20/20.

<h3> Description of Each Page + Wireframes </h3>
Firstly, we have the sign-up page.

![alt](./assets/Wireframe_sign_up.png)
This page will have an animated background, with textboxes for username, password, jersey number, and confirm password. All of thse will be used to differentiate accounts, as well as allow someone to create a new account. The data will be stored. <h3> NOTE THAT YOU NEED TO SIGN-UP AN ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO ACCESS MINIGAMES</h3>

Next is the log-in page

![alt](/assets/Wireframe_log_in.png)
This page will be used in order to log-in to an existing account. This will be used in case you are signed-out and need to log back in. It will take your username, password, and jersey number and see if they match with an account for you to access it.

Next is the profile page.

![alt](/assets/Wireframe_profile.png)
This page will showcase a customizable profile. It will display all sorts of information gathered from the text boxes and html forms from different pages. You can only access this page if you have signed-in into an account. It will have different info related to you as shown. There is also an edit profile button to help you edit and customize your profile.
On the right side of the profile, there are customizable descriptions and preferences. On the right side, you can see the different statistics of your scores on the different minigames.

Next is the edit profile page. 

![alt](/assets/Wireframe_profile_edit.png)
Similar to the profile page, this is pretty much the same except that there are now radio selectors (the circles that are clickable) and input boxes for you to fill in. You can freely edit your profile on this page.

Next is the quiz page from the minigames page.

![alt](/assets/Wireframe_quiz.png)
The quiz page will showcase 20 different questions that can either be fill-in-the-blank questions, multiple choice questions, or select multiple choices questions. There is a main window showcasing the question as well as ways to answer it. At the bottom of the page, you will see two buttons and circles. The circles are a visual indicator of what question you are on. The two buttons allow you to switch the slide to show the next question or the question before the current one. At the end of the slider, you will see your score on the slider like this (please note that this is not a separate page)

![alt](/assets/Wireframe_quiz_score.png)
There are now two new buttons, the record score and try again button. The try again button will reset all your quiz data and send you back to the beginning with a few new questions. The record score button will showcase your score on your profile, updating it.
