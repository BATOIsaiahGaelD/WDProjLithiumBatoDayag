<h3>JavaScript Implementation:</h3>
JavaScript plays an important role in web development by transforming a static HTML and CSS into a dynamic, lively, and interactive experience for users. This includes features such as drop down menus, checkboxes, etc. Some pages require to click in order to show info, so we will be using javascript. Animations will also be present in many of the pages, an example is the disc spinning. One entire page is about minigames such as clicking at the correct time, rolling a random disc color, and a quiz, so we will be using javascript to code those games.
